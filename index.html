                            <p>Can you write a complete HTML document without consulting a cheat sheet and understand the concept behind semantic markup?</p>
                            <p>Do you know how <a href="">to write clean</a> and cross browser friendly CSS, create sophisticated layouts, and have a good understanding of how to solve IE 6 related issues?</p>
                            <p>Are you a fan of Crockford and have viewed at least one of his many JavaScript presentations? Do you know how to create clean and organized <a href="">object</a> oriented JavaScript even though there are no convenient out of the box solutions?</p>
                            <p>Are you conscious of code maintainability and create modules for reusable and loosely coupled JavaScript code?
                            Do you foam at the mouth upon a new jQuery release or make use of at least one cutting edge JavaScript framework?
                            Do you understand that with great power comes great responsibility and are always conscious of sluggish or inefficient DOM manipulation? Given a <a href="">slow performing</a> web app, do you have a checklist of things to look for to improve speed?
                            Can you cut it on the backend side? Do you have a good understanding of object oriented PHP and now how to create robust AJAX applications? Can you maintain or create a clean and well thought out MySQL database?
                            Have you heard of Comet or understand the benefits of long polling?
                            Lastly, do you consider yourself a humble person and can adapt to changes or critiques to your work without taking it personally?</p>
